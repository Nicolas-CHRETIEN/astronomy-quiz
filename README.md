 ### First of all, you can choose between 6 different themes:
 
 Solar system, stars, constellations, space exploration, space history and science fiction.
 You also can select "general" which combine both of all themes.

### There are three levels of difficulty:

The 10 first questions are quite easy to answer, the 10 next are a little bit more difficult and all the others following are meant to be very difficult.

For each question, 4 answers are given. Only one is correct.
As the game was built to be hard, the difficulty increases the more you answer questions correctly. 
Each 10 good answers, 1 possible answer is added to the answers given.

### One wrong answer is a game over.
But you have several "jockers" to help you avoid a difficult question:

  - The first one withdraws half of the possible answers.
  - The second one skips the question and ask you directly the next one.
  - The third gives you a try with no consequences in case of failure.

After you give an answer, a short text tells you if you're wrong or write and give you an explanation.
Each good answer is one step to further the game in background in which you have to send a rocket through space and go as far as you can. 
Of course, a wrong answer stops the mission.

You can take a break as soon as you reach 20 good answers.
At the end of the game, you can give your name and your score will be saved in the table score.
Data are stored with local storage for the moment, everything is done in front end.

I created this code at the very beginning of my education, before I began the training.
That's why it's so simple.
